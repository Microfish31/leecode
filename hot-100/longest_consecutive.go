// Time Complexity: O(n)
//   - Each number is processed at most once
// Space Complexity: O(n)
//   - A map is used to store all unique numbers
// Runtime: 59 ms
// Memory: 11.74 MB
//
// Key Idea:
// 1. Use a map (as a set) for O(1) lookups.
// 2. Only start counting a sequence from numbers that are the beginning of a sequence.
// 3. Avoid redundant work by ensuring each sequence is only explored once.
//
// Common Mistakes (That Cause O(nÂ²) Time Complexity):
// 1. Scanning upward or downward from every number without skipping already processed parts
//    This results in repeatedly traversing the same sequences multiple times.
// 2. Forgetting to check if the number is the start of a sequence (`num - 1` not in the set)
//    Without this condition, the same sequence can be recomputed from different starting points.
